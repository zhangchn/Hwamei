# Hwamei
A d3.js-inspired library for Quartz Core in Swift programming language.

It is aimed at formalizing its data binding procedures in a clearly defined way that the types of arguments are explicitly expressed, rather than implicitly and/or with ubiquitous type coercion. 

## How to hack

1. Clone/download the source code;
2. Open Hwamei.xcworkspace with Xcode;
3. Hack with the APIs in various playground files;
4. Modify the framework in Hwamei project.
